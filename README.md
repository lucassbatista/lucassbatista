# Hi there :relaxed:

My name is Lucas Batista, I am a Software Developer Analyst. I love to bring new ideas and solve real problems. Currently working a lot with the .NET platform.

I am very interested in Software Architecture, I love to study and apply design / architecture standards. About this, I am currently studying and applying DDD in the projects I have been working on.

Passionate about development, currently studying frontend languages like JavaScript and its react and Angular frameworks, in search of being a more complete professional.

I love to have fun programming, creating side projects all the time validating concepts or just stupid ideas.
